# PHP Input Validation
## Work in progress

Easy to use PHP class for validating user input from HTML form input fields or anywhere else you may use it.

Please note this is only `validation`, for very critical operations you may need to consider `sanitizing` before submitting user data to DB etc. I assume you're already well aware of the dangers.

### Features

- Whitelist: if input should ONLY contain one of these words
- Blacklist: if input should NOT contain one of these words
- Custom error messages for each input field
- Lightweight and fast
- Validate different types of input:
 - Telephone number
 - Email address
 - Name
 - Text
 - ++

### Usage examples
